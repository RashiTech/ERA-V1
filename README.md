## Session 5
## Identification of handwritten numbers MNIST dataset using Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network
The code is written in Python and the neural network is built using PyTorch framework.

Modular structure followed for writing the code.

utils.py is the custom module holding datasets tyransformation functions, train-test functions , plotting and optimizing functions.
model.py is the custom module holding network architecture.
S5.ipynb is the main code file where functions from the utils.py and model.py are called to meet the objective.
